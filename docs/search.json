More responded to this question than to any other open-ended prompt on the survey (177). Twenty-five percent of responses listed two or more locations, often with an explanation of their different purposes. Favorite places to study include the atrium (51 mentions), the silent sections (50 mentions), reservable study rooms (29 mentions), and individual carrels (20 mentions). The Gold Zone is a small sleeper hit with nine specific mentions. The furniture in the new data science center was the subject of five comments, all of them appreciative.\nSound was the most frequently cited reason for selecting a study space, with 85 mentions. While some respondents noted that their preferences depend on the task at hand, a clear majority expressed a preference for quiet or silence. Other influential factors included the proximity of windows (50 comments), soft seating (18 comments), and privacy (16 mentions). Lesser considerations included quality of artificial lighting, outlets, whiteboards, plants, and proximity to the service desk or restrooms.",

If you could change one thing to make it a more welcoming place, what would it be?\nOne hundred and twenty-nine students responded to the final open-ended question, and responses were overwhelmingly positive, with many mentioning multiple things they valued in a single response. Many students appreciated the architectural beauty of Watzek Library, with its windows and views mentioned frequently. Students valued the variety of seating areas within the library, including spaces for quiet reading and contemplation, the reservable study rooms, and spaces for group study and socialization. Some commented on this variety as being conducive to meeting different needs and preferences on different days. Library resources, helpful service from staff and student workers, library exhibits and programming, and 24/5 building access were also valued by respondents.\n\n\nSuggested improvements included adding more comfortable seating throughout the library, providing spaces with softer lighting, soundproofing the study rooms, and adding a cafe. Students also requested increased access to outlets and additional cozy reading nooks.\nGraduate students especially appreciated the delivery service, online textbooks, and streaming services, while noting the library‚Äôs location and lack of parking as deterrents to visiting the physical space.",

    "text": "What other research tools do you rely on?\nnote: this is a summary of questions 9, 10, and 12\nStudents were asked to rate the usefulness of four tools‚ÄîPrimo, library databases, Google, and Google Scholar‚Äîfor starting a research project, and then were asked three open-ended questions about research. A dwindling minority of respondents engaged with these questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other research tools do you rely on?\n102 responses\n\n\nAre there research tools or resources lacking in our collection that you would like to see added?\n83 responses\n\n\nPlease share any comments about the research tools and resources listed above.\n54 responses\n\n\n\nAcross the three questions, ‚Äúresearch tools and resources‚Äô‚Äô emerged as a nebulous category encompassing people, library services, and ancillary tools such as citation managers and guides. Among people, librarians were mentioned by the greatest number of respondents as valued resources. Faculty were directly mentioned almost as often; arguably, the assigned readings and textbooks that students reported relying on for research also represent faculty influence. Several students said they relied on peers, and two reported using networks or contacting an author to get what they needed. A number of responses repeated resources named in previous closed questions; Primo, the most popular of these, appeared in nine responses. Also named were PsycNet (in three comments), PsycVideos, Annual Reviews, PubMed, Project Muse, and SOAN resources. A handful of respondents mentioned books or bibliographies as essential to their research. Several students reported using other libraries. Surprisingly, the Internet Archive was mentioned by three respondents, while Wikipedia was named only once. A lone mention of SciHub was the only indication (or admission) of reliance on the dark web.\nOf the 83 respondents to the question about tools or resources lacking in the collection, more than half (51) indicated that they saw no such gaps, with several expressing appreciation for having ‚Äúthorough access to a lot of academic resources.‚Äù Some respondents named existing resources; several ideas were not clearly feasible, such as adding the Internet Archive. Within the realm of the feasible, commenters expressed interest in having access to APA PsycTests, more STEM resources, mental health journals, resources for school psychology, ‚Äúa larger children‚Äôs fiction section for leisurely reading,‚Äù and a handful of even more specific resources. Access to ‚Äútextbooks‚Äù came up three times, with one person expressing a wish for more copies of required course textbooks and another for more ‚Äúe-textbooks for courses.‚Äù As above, it seems likely but not entirely clear that course reserves are indicated.\nSeveral comments on this question imply a need for more instruction on how to use ‚Äúthe research resources.‚Äù One person suggested adding ‚Äúa brief 101 on how best to use Primo search.‚Äù The number of resources erroneously named as unavailable‚ÄîScience, Nature, JSTOR, the New York Times, Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, and loanable headphones‚Äîalso suggests room for improvement in how we advertise and communicate about resources. One person complained about the level of access to Special Collections, ‚Äúespecially in regards to this History of our school as a colonial project.‚Äù\nThe majority of comments on the final question, ‚ÄúPlease share any comments about the research tools and resources listed above,‚Äù seemed influenced by the immediately preceding closed question about about format preferences. While a small number declared a positive preference for ebooks or print, more volunteered a more nuanced position, of which the following comments are representative:\n\nI prefer to read real books but ebooks are better for finding things via search\n\n\nI love printed books but sometimes ebooks are easier\n\n\nEbooks are more convenient but sometimes a physical copy is needed\n\nSeveral comments from graduate students suggested frustrations that are harder to mitigate. One, who is legally blind, suggested more availability of textbooks in audio format for greater accessibility. Others reported running into resources restricted to Boley, which may warrant reexamining the language users encounter in Primo in this scenario. Most responses to this final question, however, ranged from neutral (e.g., ‚ÄúPrimo is great but the search function could be improved‚Äù) to positive, some of which were downright exuberant in their punctuation:\n\nThey‚Äôre all very awesome.\n\n\nPrimo has been a great resource for research in my graduate coursework.\n\n\nLove the resources\n\n\nI love primo. you guys should make primo merch.\n\n\nI really enjoy the databases such as Primo or Jstor\n\n\nI‚Äôm really grateful for the sheer number of resources we have!\n\n\nI LOVE THE RESOURCE LIBRARIANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nHaving Elaine come to my research class and showing us resources and tools for research was very helpful\n\n\nI love accessing articles online!!!",

    "text": "What frustrates you about doing research?\nMany students (126) expressed a number of frustrations about doing research, with repeated emphasis on discovering items without the full text appended and/or encountering paywalls. This recurring complaint might indicate that our deep journal cuts are having an impact on user attitudes and their ability to conduct research. Common concerns centered on the time-intensive nature of scholarly research, including approaching and scoping a topic, identifying and evaluating relevant sources, creating citations, and somewhat surprisingly, reading. Interface design was another common critique. The Watzek website and Primo were described by a senior as ‚Äúgreat but clunky. It gets frustrating having to sign in through multiple portals just to get to one resource or article.‚Äù\nLibrary instruction and research consultations should be helpful to students learning how to approach the research process more effectively; these are also opportunities for staff to acknowledge the time-consuming reality of an effective research experience. Although the Discovery Team meets monthly to adapt the Primo interface, it has been more than five years since there was any user testing and design rethinking of the library‚Äôs website. This could be a consideration for the future.",
