A dwindling minority of respondents engaged with these questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other research tools do you rely on?\n102 responses\n\n\nAre there research tools or resources lacking in our collection that you would like to see added?\n83 responses\n\n\nPlease share any comments about the research tools and resources listed above.\n54 responses\n\n\n\nAcross the three questions, “research tools and resources’’ emerged as a nebulous category encompassing people, library services, and ancillary tools such as citation managers and guides. Among people, librarians were mentioned by the greatest number of respondents as valued resources. Faculty were directly mentioned almost as often; arguably, the assigned readings and textbooks that students reported relying on for research also represent faculty influence. Several students said they relied on peers, and two reported using networks or contacting an author to get what they needed. A number of responses repeated resources named in previous closed questions; Primo, the most popular of these, appeared in nine responses. Also named were PsycNet (in three comments), PsycVideos, Annual Reviews, PubMed, Project Muse, and SOAN resources. A handful of respondents mentioned books or bibliographies as essential to their research. Several students reported using other libraries. Surprisingly, the Internet Archive was mentioned by three respondents, while Wikipedia was named only once. A lone mention of SciHub was the only indication (or admission) of reliance on the dark web.\nOf the 83 respondents to the question about tools or resources lacking in the collection, more than half (51) indicated that they saw no such gaps, with several expressing appreciation for having “thorough access to a lot of academic resources.” Some respondents named existing resources; several ideas were not clearly feasible, such as adding the Internet Archive. Within the realm of the feasible, commenters expressed interest in having access to APA PsycTests, more STEM resources, mental health journals, resources for school psychology, “a larger children’s fiction section for leisurely reading,” and a handful of even more specific resources. Access to “textbooks” came up three times, with one person expressing a wish for more copies of required course textbooks and another for more “e-textbooks for courses.” As above, it seems likely but not entirely clear that course reserves are indicated.\nSeveral comments on this question imply a need for more instruction on how to use “the research resources.” One person suggested adding “a brief 101 on how best to use Primo search.” The number of resources erroneously named as unavailable—Science, Nature, JSTOR, the New York Times, Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, and loanable headphones—also suggests room for improvement in how we advertise and communicate about resources. One person complained about the level of access to Special Collections, “especially in regards to this History of our school as a colonial project.”\nThe majority of comments on the final question, “Please share any comments about the research tools and resources listed above,” seemed influenced by the immediately preceding closed question about about format preferences.

    "text": "What frustrates you about doing research?\nMany students (126) expressed a number of frustrations about doing research, with repeated emphasis on discovering items without the full text appended and/or encountering paywalls. This recurring complaint might indicate that our deep journal cuts are having an impact on user attitudes and their ability to conduct research. Common concerns centered on the time-intensive nature of scholarly research, including approaching and scoping a topic, identifying and evaluating relevant sources, creating citations, and somewhat surprisingly, reading. Interface design was another common critique. The Watzek website and Primo were described by a senior as “great but clunky. It gets frustrating having to sign in through multiple portals just to get to one resource or article.”\nLibrary instruction and research consultations should be helpful to students learning how to approach the research process more effectively; these are also opportunities for staff to acknowledge the time-consuming reality of an effective research experience. Although the Discovery Team meets monthly to adapt the Primo interface, it has been more than five years since there was any user testing and design rethinking of the library’s website. This could be a consideration for the future.",

If you could change one thing to make it a more welcoming place, what would it be?\nOne hundred and twenty-nine students responded to the final open-ended question, and responses were overwhelmingly positive, with many mentioning multiple things they valued in a single response. Many students appreciated the architectural beauty of Watzek Library, with its windows and views mentioned frequently. Students valued the variety of seating areas within the library, including spaces for quiet reading and contemplation, the reservable study rooms, and spaces for group study and socialization. Some commented on this variety as being conducive to meeting different needs and preferences on different days. Library resources, helpful service from staff and student workers, library exhibits and programming, and 24/5 building access were also valued by respondents.\n\n\nSuggested improvements included adding more comfortable seating throughout the library, providing spaces with softer lighting, soundproofing the study rooms, and adding a cafe. Students also requested increased access to outlets and additional cozy reading nooks.\nGraduate students especially appreciated the delivery service, online textbooks, and streaming services, while noting the library’s location and lack of parking as deterrents to visiting the physical space.",

    "text": "Please share any comments about the resources listed above. (in reference to question 5)\nThe first section of the survey asked a series of questions about study spaces, course reserves, resource sharing, printing, computing, and circulating equipment. Respondents were then invited to comment on any of these library resources, eliciting a total of 80 responses. The greatest number of these were positive comments about the library and its staff in general. \n\n“They’re all very awesome.”\n\n\n“I love the library!!! Everyone who works there is so incredibly helpful and awesome.”\n\n\n“Everything is so accessible! Yay!”\n\n\n“Love Watzek!”\n\n\n“I have found everyone at the library super helpful!”\n\nCourse textbooks were mentioned most frequently in terms of specific resources. Seven of the ten comments about textbooks came from graduate students noting a need for additional copies. While some of these comments specifically referenced course reserves, others did not distinguish between print reserves, circulating copies, and e-book access. Elsewhere in the survey, graduate students noted that it is inconvenient for them to visit the library in person. Regardless of format, they seem to expect on some level that the library will supply required texts. As one stated, “There should be more than one reserve book to be able to read from reserves, or check out. Or, a digital copy should be made available to check out. Some chosen course textbooks are expensive and unavailable. Libraries are meant to help ease the financial burden by helping students access these.” We may want to conduct a follow-up assessment about the feasibility of a satellite, self-service reserve collection for the graduate school. \nNoise, study rooms, and printing were the other topics most frequently commented upon. While expressing appreciation for collaborative study spaces, respondents also remarked on issues connected with them: noise from collaborative areas carries into quiet zones, and the distinction between individual and collaborative space is unclear. Similarly, opinions on the study rooms were mixed, with several respondents noting problems with the reservation system: reservations must be made at least an hour in advance, it is difficult to tell if a room has been reserved, and it is awkward for reservation holders to ask someone to vacate a room. While two respondents expressed appreciation for free printing, the majority of remarks about the printers were complaints about how frequently they are out of order (or out of toner).\nThough mentioned less often, Summit, interlibrary loan, and delivery service to the graduate campus received consistently positive reviews. Students appreciated the equipment available to borrow from the service desk, but would like longer loan periods. One person described library seating as “not fat-friendly,” and said that this has discouraged their use of the library as a study space—a critique that we should keep in mind as we work to be more inclusive.",
